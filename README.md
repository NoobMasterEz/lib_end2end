End-to-end learning process is a type of Deep_learning process in which all of the parameters are trained jointly, rather than step by step. [2] Furthermore, just like in the case of Deep_learning process, in end-to-end learning process the machine uses previously gained human input, in order to execute its task.[3] This process is specifically prevalent in the autonomous cars industry(our 2018's case study), as this process's benefits fit perfectly with the car's Convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
